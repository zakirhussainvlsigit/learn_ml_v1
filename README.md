- Types of ML Systems
    - ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:
        - Supervised learning
        - Unsupervised learning
        - Reinforcement learning
        - Generative AI

### Supervised learning

- These ML systems are "supervised" in the sense that a human gives the ML system data with the known correct results.

- Two of the most common use cases for supervised learning are regression and classification.
